To run
* Checkout this repository
* Open the repository in VSCode
* Open a terminal in VSCode (press ctrl + `)
* npm install express
* run node.exe index.js

It will hopefully be running now, you can go to a browser and set the address as 127.0.0.1:8000
* Try using the browsers developer tools to see what is going on
* Click where it says "This is my text" and see what happens. Can you find the code that causes this?
